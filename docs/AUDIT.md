# Full audit

Run `npm run audit` first, then work through the hardware checklist below.

The script covers what a machine can check. The checklist covers what it cannot, and
that is the half that has found every real fault so far: a request frame missing its
command byte, a run that kept transmitting after its tab closed, a disconnected radio
reported as packet loss, a duration estimate four times out. None of those failed a
test or a build at the time.

## Why drift matters here

This fork depends on facts about other people's code, and those facts can change
without anything here breaking loudly.

`meshcore.js` does not implement repeater discovery, so this app writes the request
frame and parses the reply itself. Command `55` and push code `0x8E` are hard coded.
If the firmware renumbers them, discovery will report **"No repeater answered"** —
which is a legitimate result, so it reads as an answer rather than a fault. The script
checks those constants against the firmware source for exactly that reason.

It also warns if the library starts implementing control data, because at that point
the hand written frames should be deleted rather than maintained.

## What the script checks

| Group | Checks |
| ----- | ------ |
| Tests and build | six node suites, the component suites, a production build |
| meshcore.js | installed version, a newer release, `AdvType.Repeater`, whether control data is still unimplemented |
| Firmware | `CMD_SEND_CONTROL_DATA`, `PUSH_CODE_CONTROL_DATA`, `DISCOVER_REQ`, `DISCOVER_RESP`, `MAX_TEXT_LEN` |
| Upstream | commits in `liamcottle/meshcore-web` not in this fork |
| Deployment | the live build matches the local one, the tree is clean, everything is pushed |

Network checks are skipped rather than failed when offline, so an audit in the field
still tells you whether the app works.

## Hardware checklist

Two radios, both powered. Test on the **Emcomm Testing** channel, never Public, and
mark every transmission `DRILL`. Roughly 20 to 30 transmissions in total.

Connect each radio in its own browser tab; a radio can only be held by one page.

### Sending

- [ ] **Multi-part report to a channel.** Every part arrives on the other node, in
      order, with `[1/2]` style markers. This is the path most likely to regress,
      because the send loop is where the reliability work happened.
- [ ] **Multi-part report direct to a contact.** Every part reports **Delivered**, and
      they go out one at a time. The device tracks a single outstanding direct message,
      so a part sent before the previous is acknowledged is simply lost.
- [ ] **Split points fall between fields**, not mid field, on a report that splits.

### Position

Worth doing on both radios if they differ, because a guard is only demonstrated by the
case it refuses.

- [ ] **A radio with GPS** fills the field, and the value is a plausible position to
      four decimal places.
- [ ] **A radio without GPS** offers `Check GPS`, probes again when pressed, and
      **leaves the field empty**. It must never write `0, 0`, which formats perfectly
      well and points at the Gulf of Guinea.

### Date time groups

- [ ] Exact, approximate (`ABT` prefix) and a range.
- [ ] A range crossing a month renders both months, `302300L SEP-010100L OCT`, rather
      than compacting and losing one.

### Ping and discovery

- [ ] **Discover** finds the repeaters in direct range, with both signal readings.
- [ ] **Clicking a discovered repeater** selects it in the picker below.
- [ ] **Ping** a repeater that answers traces. Signal readings should be exact
      multiples of 0.25, which is the sign the quarter dB decoding is right.
- [ ] **A repeater that answers discovery but not ping** is explained rather than
      looking broken. Not every repeater answers traces.

### Failure handling

These are the ones worth the trouble, because each produces a confident wrong answer
rather than an error.

- [ ] **Pull the cable mid ping run.** The run stops and says the radio disconnected.
      The replies already collected are kept and the loss figure covers only what was
      actually sent. It must not fill the remainder with timeouts.
- [ ] **Cancel a run part way.** Statistics cover the replies collected, not the whole
      intended run.
- [ ] **A run where everything times out.** Loss reads 100% and the averages are
      hidden, because `avg snr 0dB` would read as a measurement of a dead link rather
      than the absence of one.
- [ ] **A run that partly succeeds.** The loss percentage and averages are taken over
      the real replies only.
- [ ] **Switch tabs mid send.** Transmission stops. Nothing should keep talking to the
      radio with no display and no way to cancel.

### Offline

- [ ] Load the app, then stop the server and reload. It still starts from cache.
- [ ] Start the server again and reload. It picks up the current build.

## When something drifts

**A firmware constant changed.** Discovery is the thing that breaks. Read the firmware
source, update `Connection.discoverRepeaters`, and update the frame assertions in
`test/components/discovery.test.mjs` so they describe the new truth.

**The library implemented control data.** Delete the hand written frame and use the
library. Keep the tests: they assert behaviour, not implementation.

**Upstream has commits.** Read them before merging. This fork has diverged deliberately
in places, particularly around message rendering, where it preserves newlines that
upstream collapses.
